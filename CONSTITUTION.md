# Streaming — Constitution

> **Status:** Active. This document is the project's authoritative
> rule set. When a rule here conflicts with `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
> or any guide, the Constitution wins.

## Mission

See README.md.

## Mandatory Standards

1. **Reproducibility:** every change is reproducible from a clean
   clone (`git clone <repo> && <project bootstrap>`); no hidden steps.
2. **Tests track behavior, not code:** test what the user-visible
   behavior is, not what the implementation looks like.
3. **No silent skips, no silent mocks above unit tests.**
4. **Conventional Commits** for all commits.
5. **SSH-only for git operations** (`git@…`); HTTPS prohibited.

## Numbered Rules

<!-- Rules are numbered CONST-NNN. New rules append. Removed rules
     keep their number with a "**Retired:** …" line. -->

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

### CONST-033 — Host Power Management is Forbidden

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable. Applies to every project,
submodule, container entry point, build script, test, challenge, and
systemd unit shipped from this repository.

**Rule:** No code in this repository may invoke a host-level power-
state transition (suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-
hibernate, poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec) on the host machine. This
includes — but is not limited to:

- `systemctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}`
- `loginctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}`
- `pm-{suspend,hibernate,suspend-hybrid}`
- `shutdown {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to any value other than `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

**Why:** The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI-agent and
container workloads. On 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host was auto-
suspended by the GDM greeter's idle policy mid-session, killing
HelixAgent and 41 dependent services. Recurring memory-pressure
SIGKILLs of `user@1000.service` (perceived as "logged out") have the
same outcome. Auto-suspend, hibernate, and any power-state transition
are unsafe for this host.

**Defence in depth (mandatory artifacts in every project):**
1. `scripts/host-power-management/install-host-suspend-guard.sh` —
   privileged installer, manual prereq, run once per host with sudo.
   Masks `sleep.target`, `suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`,
   `hybrid-sleep.target`; writes `AllowSuspend=no` drop-in; sets
   logind `IdleAction=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
2. `scripts/host-power-management/user_session_no_suspend_bootstrap.sh` —
   per-user, no-sudo defensive layer. Idempotent. Safe to source from
   `start.sh` / `setup.sh` / `bootstrap.sh`.
3. `scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` —
   static scanner. Exits non-zero on any forbidden invocation.
4. `challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` — asserts
   the running host's state matches layer-1 masking.
5. `challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` — wraps the
   scanner as a challenge that runs in CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Enforcement:** Every project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`
equivalent MUST run both challenges (host state + source tree). A
violation in either channel blocks merge. Adding files to the
scanner's `EXCLUDE_PATHS` requires an explicit justification comment
identifying the non-host context.

**See also:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` for full background and
runbook.

## Definition of Done

A change is done when:

1. The code change is committed.
2. All project-level tests pass on a clean clone.
3. All challenges in `challenges/scripts/` pass on the running host.
4. Governance docs (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) are
   coherent with the change.

<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.

<!-- BEGIN anti-bluff-testing addendum (Article XI) -->

## Article XI — Anti-Bluff Testing (MANDATORY)

**Inherited from the umbrella project's Constitution Article XI.
Tests and Challenges that pass without exercising real end-user
behaviour are forbidden in this submodule too.**

Every test, every Challenge, every HelixQA bank entry MUST:

1. **Assert on a concrete end-user-visible outcome** — rendered DOM,
   DB rows that a real query would return, files on disk, media that
   actually plays, search results that actually contain expected
   items. Not "no error" or "200 OK".
2. **Run against the real system below the assertion.** Mocks/stubs
   are permitted ONLY in unit tests (`*_test.go` under `go test
   -short` or language equivalent). Integration / E2E / Challenge /
   HelixQA tests use real containers, real databases, real
   renderers. Unreachable real-system → skip with `SKIP-OK:
   #<ticket>`, never silently pass.
3. **Include a matching negative.** Every positive assertion is
   paired with an assertion that fails when the feature is broken.
4. **Emit copy-pasteable evidence** — body, screenshot, frame, DB
   row, log excerpt. Boolean pass/fail is insufficient.
5. **Verify "fails when feature is removed."** Author runs locally
   with the feature commented out; the test MUST FAIL. If it still
   passes, it's a bluff — delete and rewrite.
6. **No blind shells.** No `&& echo PASS`, `|| true`, `tee` exit
   laundering, `if [ -f file ]` without content assertion.

**Challenges in this submodule** must replay the user journey
end-to-end through the umbrella project's deliverables — never via
raw `curl` or third-party scripts. Sub-1-second Challenges almost
always indicate a bluff.

**HelixQA banks** declare executable actions
(`adb_shell:`, `playwright:`, `http:`, `assertVisible:`,
`assertNotVisible:`), never prose. Stagnation guard from Article I
§1.3 applies — frame N+1 identical to frame N for >10 s = FAIL.

**PR requirement:** every PR adding/modifying a test or Challenge in
this submodule MUST include a fenced `## Anti-Bluff Verification`
block with: (a) command run, (b) pasted output, (c) proof the test
fails when the feature is broken (second run with feature
commented-out showing FAIL).

**Cross-reference:** umbrella `CONSTITUTION.md` Article XI
(§§ 11.1 — 11.8).

<!-- BEGIN user-mandate forensic anchor (Article XI §11.9) -->

## ⚠️ User-Mandate Forensic Anchor (Article XI §11.9 — 2026-04-29)

Inherited from the umbrella project. Verbatim user mandate:

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success
> and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the
> features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the
> case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the
> quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the
> product!"

**The operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests
pass" but **"users can use the feature."**

Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive evidence captured
during execution that the feature works for the end user. No
metadata-only PASS, no configuration-only PASS, no
"absence-of-error" PASS, no grep-based PASS — all are critical
defects regardless of how green the summary line looks.

Tests and Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally. A Challenge that
scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of
defect as a unit test that does.

**No false-success results are tolerable.** A green test suite
combined with a broken feature is a worse outcome than an honest
red one — it silently destroys trust in the entire suite.

Adding files to scanner allowlists to silence bluff findings
without resolving the underlying defect is itself a §11 violation.
